        "CoN addresses the challenges of reliability in retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) which integrate external knowledge to reduce factual inaccuracies. Despite their capabilities, standard RALMs often struggle to filter out irrelevant or unreliable information, leading to potentially incorrect responses. CoN enhances RALMs by evaluating the relevance of retrieved documents and prioritizing information that is both essential and reliable. This technique helps refine the responses of LLMs, making them more accurate and contextually appropriate by excluding non-essential content.\n",

            "3. **UNFCCC Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) Registry:**  A platform containing information on countries' individual climate action plans (NDCs).\n",

            "5. **Scholarly articles:** Numerous peer-reviewed articles analyzing various aspects of the Paris Agreement, including its effectiveness, legal implications, and impact on specific sectors. (Examples: articles in *Nature Climate Change*, *Science*, *Global Environmental Politics*)\n",

            "3. **NDC Registry:**  Reliable, official UN source, provides transparent information on countries' commitments.\n",

While the agreement provides a framework for achieving these goals, current national commitments are insufficient.  The IPCC report underscores the urgency of enhanced ambition, highlighting the severe consequences of exceeding 1.5°C warming.  Ongoing challenges include closing the emissions gap, ensuring adequate finance for developing countries, and addressing issues of equity and fairness. The success of the Paris Agreement ultimately hinges on the continued commitment and strengthened actions of all participating nations, as well as increased cooperation and innovation.

            "As the Indian Budget 2024 is yet to be presented (typically in February), currently available information primarily focuses on pre-budget expectations, expert predictions, and economic outlooks. Therefore, this analysis focuses on those preliminary aspects and will require updating once the official budget documents are released.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Step 1: Identifying Relevant Documents and Sources**\n",
            "\n",
            "Due to the forward-looking nature of the topic, official documents from UN/World Bank/IMF specifically addressing the 2024 budget are not yet available. However, their general economic outlooks for India provide context.  Relevant sources include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO):**  Provides global and country-specific economic forecasts, including for India. (Reliability: High - Published by a reputable international organization, uses rigorous methodology).\n",
            "2. **World Bank India Development Update:** Offers periodic assessments of India's economic situation and development challenges. (Reliability: High - Similar to IMF WEO).\n",
            "3. **Reports from Indian credit rating agencies (e.g., CRISIL, ICRA, CARE):**  Offer insights into India's macroeconomic environment and fiscal outlook. (Reliability: Moderate to High - Reputable domestic agencies, but may have some inherent bias).\n",
            "4. **Pre-budget consultations and memoranda submitted to the Ministry of Finance:**  Reflect stakeholder expectations and suggestions.  (Reliability: Moderate - Depends on the specific stakeholder and their vested interests).\n",
            "5. **Articles in reputable financial newspapers and journals (e.g., The Economic Times, Business Standard, Livemint, The Hindu Business Line):**  Provide expert analysis and predictions about the upcoming budget. (Reliability: Moderate to High - Depends on the author's expertise and the publication's reputation).\n",
            "6. **Scholarly articles on Indian fiscal policy and public finance:** Offer theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence relevant to budget analysis. (Reliability: High - Peer-reviewed research, but may not be specifically focused on the 2024 budget).\n",

            "**Step 2 & 3: Evaluating Relevance and Summarizing Key Points**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **IMF WEO/World Bank Reports:** These reports typically project India's GDP growth, inflation, and other macroeconomic indicators. These projections indirectly influence budget expectations, as the government needs to consider the economic backdrop when formulating fiscal policies.\n",
            "* **Credit Rating Agencies:** Their reports assess India's sovereign credit rating and fiscal strength. They often highlight key challenges and suggest policy recommendations, which can influence the budget's focus.\n",
            "* **Pre-budget Consultations:** These provide insights into specific sectoral demands and expectations. For example, the industry might seek tax breaks, while social sector organizations might advocate for increased spending on welfare programs.\n",
            "* **Financial News and Expert Opinions:** These sources offer predictions about potential budget announcements, including tax changes, infrastructure spending, and social welfare measures.  They also analyze the likely impact of these measures on different sectors and the overall economy.\n",
            "* **Scholarly Articles:** These can provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of past fiscal policies and offer theoretical frameworks for evaluating the budget's potential impact.\n",

            "\n",
            "At this stage, conflicting information is primarily in the form of varying predictions and expectations about the budget. For instance, some experts might predict tax cuts to boost consumption, while others might advocate for increased public investment.  Evaluating the trustworthiness of these predictions involves considering the author's expertise, the methodology used, and any potential biases. Cross-referencing information across multiple reputable sources helps in identifying a more reliable consensus view.\n",

Experts and stakeholders are offering their wish lists and predictions based on the current economic situation and the government's stated priorities.  Key areas of focus are likely to include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Economic Growth:**  Boosting economic growth through investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and innovation.\n",
            "* **Fiscal Consolidation:** Managing the fiscal deficit and ensuring debt sustainability.\n",
            "* **Inflation Control:**  Addressing inflationary pressures through appropriate monetary and fiscal policies.\n",
            "* **Social Welfare:**  Continuing and expanding social safety nets and welfare programs.\n",
