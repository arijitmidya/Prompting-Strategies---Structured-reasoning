        "\n",
        "Developed as an enhancement to existing semantic reasoning prompts, CoC specifically targets tasks requiring numeric or symbolic reasoning, which are typically challenging for standard LLMs. It prompts LLMs to treat these tasks as code problems, formatting them into executable pseudo code that can be processed by an interpreter. CoC improves LLM reasoning by leveraging code writing to tackle both logic and semantic tasks. This allows the model to handle undefined behaviors and simulate responses, improving accuracy in logic-based reasoning tasks over traditional methods\n",

            "     - `1 + r/n`:  Represents the growth factor for each compounding period.  It's 1 plus the interest rate per period, indicating how much the principal grows by each time interest is applied.  In our case, it's 1 + 0.0125 = 1.0125.\n",
            "     - `(1 + r/n)^(n*t)`: This part calculates the total growth factor over the entire investment period.  `n*t` represents the total number of compounding periods (4 times a year for 5 years = 20 periods).  We raise the growth factor per period (1.0125) to the power of the total number of periods (20) to get the overall growth.  This is the effect of compounding – earning interest on the accumulated interest.\n",
