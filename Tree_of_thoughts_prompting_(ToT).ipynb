        "An extension of CoT, ToT structures the reasoning process into a tree of intermediate steps, enhancing the model’s ability to explore different reasoning pathways and arrive at a well-rounded solution. ToT manages a tree structure of intermediate reasoning steps known as thoughts. Each thought represents a coherent language sequence moving toward the final solution. This structure allows language models to reason by assessing the progress generated by thoughts in solving the problem.\n",
